    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a second-year Data Science for Public Policy student originally from Cleveland, OH. I graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati, OH in May 2020 with an Honors Bachelor’s of Arts in Philosophy, Politics & the Public and Computer Science. From 2020-2024 I spent time as an Americorps member with City Year in Cleveland, a Public Service Fellow with the Cleveland Metroparks IT Department building out their extended reality educational programming and as an Analyst with Accenture Federal Services on a government health portfolio client. 
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
        As I prepare to re-enter the workforce I am excited to leverage my data science and policy analysis skills to advocate for equity in the criminal justice system. Through targeted research on policing reform, I want to build a knowledge base for organizations and communities to create a more effective and just system for all.
